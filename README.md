# Regression-project
Our project aims at studying which markers explain well the phenotype Alkali spreading value. First we will conduct an exploratory data analysis in order to gain a better understanding of our covariables and the target variable, Then we'll build multiple models in order to discover the covariables that have the most impact on the choosen phenotype. Finally, we will interpret the results and do a comparison between all the models we built based on the variables each model selected. Since our target variable is continuous, and our goal is to perform variable selection in order to discover which variables explains the best our target, we will use lasso regression and Elastic Net regression as well as best subset method. Also, we applied PCA in order to apply dimensionality reduction since our data is high dimensional(number of covariables is 35000 while the number of observations is approximately 403)
